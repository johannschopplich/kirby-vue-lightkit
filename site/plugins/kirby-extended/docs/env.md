# Env

Loads environment variables from `.env` automatically. This helps to store project credentials or variables outside of your code or if you want to have development and production access in different locations.

## Configuration

Create a `.env` file in Kirby's base directory. You can change the default filename to look for with the `kirby-extended.env.filename` option key.

> It is important to hide your `.env` from the public. Make sure to add it to your `.gitignore` file.

## Usage

### Inside Templates, Snippets etc.

You can use the `$page` method to retrieve an environment variable from anywhere:

```php
$page->env('VARIABLE');
```

### Within `config.php`

If you want to use variables in your `config.php` file, you have to call the `Env` class manually to load the environment object before Kirby finishes initializing.

THe first argument `path` is required. The second one (`filename`) is optional and may be used to load an environment file called something other than `.env`.

```php
\KirbyExtended\Env::load('path/to/env', '.env');
```
### Options

| Option | Default | Values | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `kirby-extended.env.path` | `kirby()->root('base')` | string | Path from which the file should be loaded. |
| `kirby-extended.env.filename` | `.env` | string | Environment filename to load. |

## Example

```ssh
# .env
KIRBY_DEBUG=false

SECRET_KEY=my_secret_key
PUBLIC_KEY=my_public_key

FOO=BAR
BAZ=${FOO}
```

With a `.env` file inside the `$base` directory in place, you can access your securely stored credentials and variables:

```php
// config.php
$base = dirname(__DIR__, 2);
\KirbyExtended\Env::load($base);

return [
    'debug' => env('KIRBY_DEBUG', false),
    'SECRET' => env('SECRET_KEY'),
    'PUBLIC' => env('PUBLIC_KEY')
];
```
