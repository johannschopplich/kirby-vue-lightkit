# Redirects

Create redirect routes easily that only take over if no actual page/route has been matched. It uses the `go()` helper under the hood.

## Configuration

Redirects have to be defined in the `kirby-extended.redirects` option key in an array with the old pattern as key and the target page/URL as value. Placeholders can be used in the key and referenced via `$1`, `$2` and so on in the target string.

Instead of a target string, a callback function returning that string may also be used.

## Options

| Option | Default | Values | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `kirby-extended.redirects` | `false` | array | List of redirects. |

## Example

```php
// config.php
return [
    'kirby-extended.redirects' => [
        // Simple redirects
        'from/foo'                  => 'to/bar',
        'blog/article-(:any)'       => 'blog/articles/$1',
        'old/reference/(:all?)'     => 'new/reference/$1',

        // Redirects with logic
        'photography/(:any)/(:all)' => function ($category, $uid) {
            if ($page = page('photography')->grandChildren()->listed()->findBy('uid', $uid)) {
                return $page->url();
            }

            return 'error';
        }
    ]
];
```
